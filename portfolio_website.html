            <h2>Portfolio Website</h2>
            <p>
                This project is exactly what you're looking at right now. I wanted to gain skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I thought what better way to do so than to create portfolio to share my work. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Skills and Technologies Used</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <li>Git</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Project Details</h3>
            <p>
                The most difficult aspect of this project was the CSS. I didn't particulary love front-end UI development at the time I started this project, but I figured it was something that could be improved. While this website is simple, styling it was not the easiest thing to do. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I really enjoyed working with JavaScript to add visible effects to the page, such as changing the theme from light to dark, as well as adding some effects on the buttons. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>
                I will continue to work on this website, as there is a lot that can be improved, but I am happy with the result of a readable, clean design. 
            </p>
