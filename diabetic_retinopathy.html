            <h2>Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Model</h2>
            <p>
                I was interested in seeing how I could apply computer vision to real life medical usage. I found diabetic retinopathy detection, which is a way that doctors look at the blood vessels in the eyes of patients as a way to determine if they have diabetes. This became a project where I could advance my skills in machine learning and computer vision while tackling a problem that affected real people, which is something that I am passionate about.

            <h3>Project Details</h3>
            <p>
                I found a dataset with 35000 images and 5 levels of classification from Kaggle, a site where people can provide solutions to real life problems such as this one. I cleaned up the dataset and did some image transformation to improve the quality of input data.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I decided to use transfer learning with EfficientNet for this project, as it is one of the highest accuracy convolution neural networks available for use. I adjusted a few layers of the model to fit against my dataset and increase accuracy. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                To train the model, I played around with different EPOCHS, batch sizes, and learning rates to reach the highest accuracy possible on the test dataset.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>
                The final model achieved an accuracy of 73.9% on the test dataset, which I was happy with for a first attempt. If I were to take more steps on this project, I would try to adjust a few more layers of EfficientNet or even build my own model from scratch to compare the accuracies. However, I learned a lot about how machine learning models were built, and this improved my success on future projects.
