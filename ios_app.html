            <h2>Recipe Book App</h2>
            <p>
                I have always been interested in the idea of building an app and putting it on the app store, but it seemed like such a foreign concept to me. I became interested in cooking, and wanted to share recipes with my family, so I figured it would be a great opportunity to build an app to do so.

            <h3>Project Details</h3>
            <p>
                The recipe book application is a full-stack development project in MVVM format. There were three primary models: the login screen, the recipe viewing screen, and the recipe adding screen. The recipe adding screen included image uploading with FirebaseStorage, as well as descriptions and food category. The recipe viewing screen allowed the user to sort included recipes by categories. Any recipes uploaded were shared among users, which was a feature I important to me because this was simply used among my family. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The other main function that was included in this app was FirebaseAuthentication. This required users to sign up and login to their account to view the recipes, which allowed me to control who had access to them, and limit it to my family.
