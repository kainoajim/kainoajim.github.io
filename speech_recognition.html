            <h2>Speech Recognition Model</h2>
            <p>
                This project involved developing an advanced speech-to-text model using PyTorch. The model converts audio input into textual output, utilizing a combination of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

            <h3>Project Details</h3>
            <p>
                The model was trained on a dataset of audio recordings, and various data preprocessing techniques were applied, including noise reduction and feature extraction. I chose LSTM models due to their ability to capture temporal dependencies in sequential data, which is crucial for accurately transcribing speech. CNNs were used for their effectiveness in identifying patterns in the spectrograms of the audio signals.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the challenges I faced was balancing the model’s complexity with its performance. After experimenting with various architectures, I implemented a hybrid model that achieved a significant improvement in accuracy.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>
                The final model achieved an accuracy of 83% on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in converting speech to text. This project enhanced my understanding of deep learning and gave me hands-on experience with both LSTM and CNN architectures.
